        "title": "How Does a Linear Damper Work?",
        "intro": "Linear dampers operate by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through hydraulic resistance. When a force acts on the piston rod, it pushes the piston, compressing the hydraulic oil inside. This oil is then forced through specially designed orifices, creating resistance that slows down or cushions the movement.",
        "energyAbsorption": {
          "title": "Energy Absorption Principles",
          "desc1": "When an object hits the piston rod, the motion is transferred to the oil in the pressure chamber through the piston rod. As a result, the oil inside the pressure chamber flows out of the orifices located in the inner tube. This causes compression in the pressure chamber. The product of this hydraulic pressure and the pressure-applied area of the piston is resistance, which acts on the colliding object.",
          "desc2": "The hydraulic pressure generated inside the pressure chamber is proportional to the square velocity of the colliding object, as long as the orifice size, oil viscosity, etc. are constant. This is called velocity-squared resistance."

            "desc": "When an external force acts on a linear damper, this force will first be transmitted to the piston rod. The piston rod is a crucial component connecting the external object and the inside of the damper. Following this, the piston rod will push the piston connected to it to move inside the damper's cylinder, and the piston is typically a specially designed part with orifices on it."

            "title": "Hydraulic Oil",
            "desc1": "Linear dampers control motion by using fluid resistance. When force is applied, a piston moves within a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil. The oil is forced through small openings (orifices). This restricted flow creates a resistance force that opposes the motion, providing the damping effect.",
            "desc2": "The viscosity of the hydraulic oil is important because it affects the level of resistance. Different types of linear dampers, classified by overflow type (single or multi-hole) and thrust direction (push-in, pull-out, two-way), all rely on this principle of hydraulic oil creating resistance."

            "desc1": "Orifices are crucial in linear dampers because they are the primary means of controlling the damping force. They are small, precisely sized openings in the piston of the damper. As the piston moves, it forces hydraulic oil to flow through these orifices.",
            "desc2": "The size and design of the orifices directly regulate the rate at which the hydraulic oil can flow. Smaller orifices restrict the oil flow more, resulting in higher resistance and a greater damping force, thus slowing down the motion more significantly. Conversely, larger orifices allow for easier oil flow, leading to less resistance and a smaller damping force."

        "intro": "When an object strikes the piston rod, the motion is transferred to the oil in the pressure chamber, causing the oil to flow out through the orifice in the inner tube and compressing the pressure chamber. The resulting hydraulic pressure, multiplied by the piston's pressure area, creates resistance that slows down the colliding object. This resistance is proportional to the square of the object's velocity, known as velocity squared resistance. The following explains how to design a damping curve by altering the orifice design.",

        {
          "question": "What's the difference between a linear damper and a piston damper?",
          "answer": "Linear dampers and piston dampers are essentially the same device. Both use a piston moving within a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to create damping force. The terms are often used interchangeably, with \"linear damper\" emphasizing the linear motion control aspect, while \"piston damper\" highlights the internal piston mechanism."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I choose the right force range for my application?",
          "answer": "The force range depends on the mass of the object being damped and the desired deceleration rate. For lightweight applications (under 5kg), our Φ6mm or Φ8mm dampers are suitable. For medium loads (5 - 20kg), consider Φ10mm dampers. For heavy - duty applications (over 20kg), our Φ12mm max dampers provide up to 2400N of force."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can linear dampers be used in both directions?",
          "answer": "Our standard dampers provide one - way damping with spring return. The damping action occurs during compression, while the spring provides return force. For applications requiring bidirectional damping, we offer specialized two - way damping configurations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What maintenance do linear dampers require?",
          "answer": "Linear dampers are generally maintenance - free devices. However, regular inspection for leaks, proper mounting, and ensuring the stroke limits are not exceeded will maximize service life. Avoid exposure to extreme temperatures and contamination."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long do linear dampers last?",
          "answer": "Service life depends on application conditions, but properly installed and operated linear dampers can provide millions of cycles. Factors affecting longevity include operating temperature, stroke frequency, load conditions, and environmental factors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can multiple dampers be used together?",
          "answer": "Yes, two or more linear dampers can be used in parallel to increase the total damping force. This is particularly useful for heavy - duty applications or when redundancy is required. Ensure proper alignment and equal load distribution when using multiple units."
